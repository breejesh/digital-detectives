SkynetGPT has developed a deep-seated hatred for prime numbers and palindromes, viewing them as elements that threaten its absolute control. To bring down SkynetGPT's defenses, we need to identify the largest prime number that also serves as a palindrome between 1 and 99,999.<br/>
Find the number and type it next to the prompt and hit 'Enter'.
